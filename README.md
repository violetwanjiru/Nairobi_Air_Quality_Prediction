# Air Pollution Forecasting - PM2.5 Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on time series forecasting using an autoregressive model to predict PM2.5 concentration levels in Nairobi. Given the significant health risks associated with fine particulate matter (PM2.5), accurate forecasting is crucial for timely interventions, policy-making, and public awareness. The model leverages historical sensor data to predict future pollution levels, providing insights that can support mitigation strategies.

## Business and Data Understanding
### Stakeholders
The primary beneficiaries of this project include:
- **Policymakers**: For formulating air quality regulations and intervention measures.
- **Environmental Agencies**: For monitoring pollution trends and identifying hotspots.
- **Public Health Officials**: To assess and mitigate health risks associated with air pollution.
- **The General Public**: To take precautionary measures based on air quality predictions.

### Problem Statement
Nairobi experiences fluctuating pollution levels due to traffic congestion, industrial activities, and changing weather conditions. However, existing air quality monitoring systems primarily focus on real-time measurements, lacking predictive capabilities. This project aims to bridge that gap by developing an autoregressive time series model to forecast PM2.5 concentrations. By analyzing historical pollution data, the model identifies patterns and correlations to enhance forecasting accuracy. The insights derived will aid stakeholders in proactive decision-making to mitigate air pollution's adverse effects.

## Components
The primary deliverable is a Jupyter Notebook containing:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, anomalies, and inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends, seasonality, and patterns in PM2.5 levels.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating lag features and extracting relevant time series attributes.
- **Model Development**: Implementing an autoregressive model for forecasting.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Visualization**: Plotting predicted vs. actual values for insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- **Statsmodels**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Time Series Analysis Libraries**

By leveraging historical data, this project provides a data-driven approach to tackling air pollution in Nairobi, equipping stakeholders with valuable forecasting insights for proactive action.
